Please answer the following questions about your work:

0 - What language did you program in?

    Typescript

1 - Have you manually tested the SDK?

    Yes, Creating a playground repository[SDK_Test](https://github.com/Gabkings/sdk_test)

2 - Did you add a test suite? If so, how will we use it? If not, why?

    No, The time limit for the development ended before I finish setting the test suites

3 - Did you use any 3rd party library? Why did you use it? What are the tradeoffs?

    No

4 - Do you feel this SDK makes it easier to interact with the API?

    Yes, software development kits (SDKs) can indeed make it easier to interact with an API 					   (Application Programming Interface). An SDK typically provides a set of tools, libraries, and documentation that simplifies the process of integrating an API into a software application.

5 - If you had more time, what else would you add?

    Test Cases

6 - What would you change in your current SDK solution?

1. Performance Optimization: Enhancements can be made to improve the speed and efficiency of the SDK, allowing for faster responses and lower resource consumption.
1. Error Handling and Robustness: Improving error handling mechanisms and implementing safeguards against unexpected inputs or disruptions can enhance the reliability and robustness of the SDK.

7 - On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the highest), how would you rate this solution?

    8/10 , considering there is still room for improvement

8 - Anything else we should keep in mind when we evaluate the project?

    Use the sdk_test repo to see how I manually tested the sdk
